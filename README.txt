TuneBuddy (wip)

A collective Spotify queue


A simple website that allows a Spotify user to invite others
to their 'room' and allow them to queue (or suggest) songs.

As of now, this website simply allows somebody to log in with
their Spotify account, and displays some of their information.

More functionality coming soon.
